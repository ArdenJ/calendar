# React/Apollo Calendar

tldr: this is a to-do list attached to some form of calendar

## Getting Started

The setup is currently a little fiddly. After cloning the repo, open the project
and run 'npm i' in the root directory. Then cd into the client and run npm i
again. THEN:

First terminal:

```
cd .. //back into root
npm run dev //build dist
```

Second terminal:

```
npm run jsonserv //runs the mock database on 3001
```

Third terminal:

```
npm run start //runs the graphql endpoint on 4000
```

Fourth (final) terminal:

```
cd client
npm start //starts the client on 3000
```

A live demo of the project will be available on Codesandbox [here](#).

## At present:

- On load the calendar renders displaying the correct month
- Individual date cards contain a list of events
- Clicking on an individual card will populate the summary with the date and any
  existing events
- New events can be added to the list by using the input
- Events can be removed from the list by pressing the cross

## Todos

- Styling
- Make the project more mobile-friendly
- Add updateEVENT mutation
- Add more depth to event listings
- Add ability to reorder events
- Tidy up typescript

## Acknowledgements

The listed articles/projects/tutorials have each helped me with this project one
way or another:

- [How to Use React Context Effectively](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/how-to-use-react-context-effectively) -
  the date.context in my project is just an expanded version of Kent's
  overengineered counter context.
- [Setting up Webpack with Apollo-Server and Typescript](https://medium.com/free-code-camp/build-an-apollo-graphql-server-with-typescript-and-webpack-hot-module-replacement-hmr-3c339d05184f) -
  This tutorial was fairly comprehensive and helped clear up a whole bunch of
  questions.

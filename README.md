# React/Apollo Calendar

tldr: this is a to-do list attached to some form of calendar

## Getting Started

The setup is currently a little fiddley. After cloning the repo, open the
project and run 'npm i' in the root directory. Then cd into the client and run
npm i again. THEN:

First terminal:

```
cd .. //back into root
npm run dev //build dist
```

Second terminal:

```
npm run jsonserv //runs the mock database on 3001
```

Third terminal:

```
npm run start //runs the graphql endpoint on 4000
```

Fourth (final) terminal:

```
cd client
npm start //starts the client on 3000
```

A live demo of the project can be viewed on Codesanbox [here](#).
